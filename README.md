  ### Result output
  + Algorithm's name
  + Execution time
  + Counters: swaps, comparisons 
  + Sorting result
  ###  Code must be covered with tests
  + sort the input array
  + sort in ascending order of sorted array in ascending order
  + sort in descending order of sorted array in ascending order
  + sort in ascending order of sorted array in descending order
  + sort in descending order of sorted array in descending order
  ### How to run
  + `cd` into folder where you want to store this repository
  + Clone this repository with command `git clone https://github.com/max-dmytryshyn/Algorithms-Labs.git`
  + Choose branch lab_1 with command `git checkout lab_1`
  + Go into folder with files with command `cd Algorithms-Labs`
  + run command `python3 heap_sort_run.py {sort order: asc or desc} {comma separated array: 1,2,3 for example}` on Mac/Linux
  + run command `py heap_sort_run.py {sort order: asc or desc} {comma separated array: 1,2,3 for example}` on Windows
